Zesje automatically grades blank answers and multiple choice questions
by applying appropriate feedback options. With auto-approve, these
selected feedback options can be approved automatically. Auto-approve
supports three different strategies:

- **Nothing**: Do not approve anything
- **Blanks**: Approve blank answers
- **One answer**: Approve multiple choice questions with only one selected option
