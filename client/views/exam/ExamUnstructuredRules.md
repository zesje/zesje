*  Add problems to the exam, the order they appear within a page is not important but the order of pages it is. Zesje will show the full page during grading and you can move through the problems associated to that page.
*  You may create a fully unstructured exam, for this add all the problems in the first page (0), Zesje will show you all the uploaded images and you will be able to scroll through all of them.
*  Remember to tell your students to upload the files in the correct format. Zesje currently supports ZIP, PDF and IMAGE files whose name has to identify the student and page. The allowed formats are:
      *  `studentId-page-copy.ext`
      *  `studentId.ext`
      *   The information can be separated in the path for ZIP files, `... studentId ../page-copy.ext` is valid.
