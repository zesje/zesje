* If the exam does not specify pages, you will see the full submission by the student for every problem.
* Otherwise when grading a problem you will only see the page to which it belongs (possibly with extra copies).
* When uploading use the filename to identify the student and the submisison pages.
    - The supported uploadformats are image files, pdf, and zip.
    - Image files must have a format `...<student>...<page>.<ext>` or `...<student>...<page>-<copy>.<ext>`, where student is either student number or full name (if unique). The copy number is used if student ran out of place on the page.
    - Standalone PDF files must contain student name or number in the filename. If they contain only one page, they should alos specify page and optoinally copy number, similar to images.
    - Zip files may specify the student in the filename or contain folders with student name or number.
