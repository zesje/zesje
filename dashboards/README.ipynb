    "*Zesje* is an online software for grading exams.\n",
    "\n",
    "As its name suggests, Zesje has been designed as a **minimal working prototype** during our free time so do not expect any degree of polish. Still it can provide a lot of advantages over manual grading, especially when dealing with large courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a tutorial and a reference documentation for Zesje. If you want to try out different software features, there is a sandbox deployment available at https://sandbox.grading.quantumtinkerer.tudelft.nl; try it out without fear of breaking things. Because of spam concerns, its email sending capabilities are limited to the [`sharklasers.com`](https://sharklasers.com) domain that provides temporary mailboxes accessible by anyone."

    "\n",
    "+ Moving the grading online: you don't need to deal with paper, updating and processing grades is automated. The grading can take place from anywhere.\n",
    "+ Zesje is faster than paper-based grading, especially for large courses\n",
    "+ Make grading streamlined by allowing to follow a grading scheme that is both clearly defined and easy to adjust.\n",
    "+ Export of grades in various formats for postprocessing.\n",
    "+ Quick built-in analysis for a progress overview.\n",
    "+ Ability to email students their solutions together with detailed feedback. From the student perspective this is the killer feature.\n",
    "+ Fully open source: if you want to modify anything and implemennt new functionality, you are welcome to do so."

You may change the *name* fields in the metadata to rename your questions accordingly. *Do not rename the \"qrcode\" metadata elements*; these are used to identify different pages in the scanned exams.\n",

If the exam was scanned at a jaunty angle, or with an offset, then the metadata that specifies the area on the page where the answer boxes are will be incorrect.
